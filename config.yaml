    description: |
      If this option is enabled, Filebeat ignores any files that were modified before the specified timespan.
      Configuring ignore_older can be especially useful if you keep log files for a long time. The passed 
      values should be integers, e.g., "90", "3600", "600". The values are assumed to be in seconds

  clean_inactive:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      When this option is enabled, Filebeat removes the state of a file after the specified period of inactivity has
      elapsed. Bear in mind that if clean_inactive is enabled, it must be greater than ignore_older + scan_frequency to
      make sure that no states are removed while a file is still being harvested. The passed values should be integers, 
      e.g., "90", "3600", "600". The values are assumed to be in seconds:
