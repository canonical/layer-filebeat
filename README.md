# Overview

Filebeat is a lightweight, open source shipper for log file data. As the
next-generation Logstash Forwarder, Filebeat tails logs and quickly sends this
information to Logstash for further parsing and enrichment or to Elasticsearch
for centralized storage and analysis.

## Usage

Filebeat can be added to any principal charm thanks to the wonders of being
a subordinate charm. The following example will deploy an ubuntu log source
along with the elk stack so we can visualize our log data.

    juju deploy ~elasticsearch-charmers/bundle/elk-stack
    juju deploy xenial/filebeat
    juju deploy xenial/ubuntu
    juju add-relation filebeat:beats-host ubuntu
    juju add-relation filebeat logstash

### Deploying the minimal Beats formation

If you do not need log buffering and alternate transforms on data that is
being shipped to ElasticSearch, you can simply deploy the 'beats-core' bundle
which stands up Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the known working Beats
subordinate applications.

    juju deploy ~containers/bundle/beats-core
    juju deploy xenial/ubuntu
    juju add-relation filebeat:beats-host ubuntu
    juju add-relation topbeat:beats-host ubuntu

### Changing what is shipped

By default, the Filebeat charm will ship any container logs present in
`/var/lib/docker/containers` as well as everything in:

    /var/log/*/*.log
    /var/log/*.log

If you'd rather target specific log files:

    juju config filebeat logpath=/var/log/mylog.log

## Testing the deployment

The applications provide extended status reporting to indicate when they are
ready:

    juju status

This is particularly useful when combined with watch to track the on-going
progress of the deployment:

    watch juju status

The message for each unit will provide information about that unit's state.
Once they all indicate that they are ready, you can navigate to the kibana
url and view the streamed log data from the Ubuntu host.

    juju status kibana --format=yaml | grep public-address

Navigate to http://&lt;kibana-ip&gt;/ in a browser and begin creating your
dashboard visualizations.

## Upgrading filebeat

Upgrades are handled at both the charm and apt repository levels. Use
`upgrade-charm` to get the latest charm code on all filebeat units:

    juju upgrade-charm filebeat

Apt repositories are scanned any time the `install_sources` config changes. If
a new version of filebeat is found in the configured repository, `juju status`
will instruct operators to run the `reinstall` action. This action must be
run on each filebeat unit:

    juju run-action --wait filebeat/0 reinstall

The `reinstall` action will stop the filebeat service, purge the apt package,
and reinstall the latest version available from the configured repository.

## Scale Out Usage

As a subordinate charm, filebeat will scale when additional principal units are
added. For example, adding `ubuntu` units that are related to `filebeat` will
automatically install and configure `filebeat` for the new unit(s).

    juju add-unit ubuntu

To monitor additional applications, simply relate the filebeat subordinate:

    juju add-relation filebeat:beats-host my-charm

## Build and publish new versions

This charm uses the reactive framework. `charm pack` is used to build a
deployable charm. In order to publish new versions of the charm, the following
commands need to be run:

**Note:** Use appropriate revision number in `charmcraft release` command.

```
charmcraft pack
charmcraft upload filebeat_ubuntu-22.04-amd64_ubuntu-20.04-amd64_ubuntu-18.04-amd64.charm
charmcraft release filebeat --revision=34 --channel=edge
charmcraft status filebeat
```
